[Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes) are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. A volume does not increase the size of the containers using it, and the volumeâ€™s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container. A Docker data volume persists after a container is deleted. There are two types of volumes to consider:
- Named volumes have a specific source from outside the container, for example awesome:/bar.
- Anonymous volumes have no specific source so when the container is deleted, instruct the Docker Engine daemon to remove them.

[Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) Basically compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.


My swarm mode was open. Firstly, I use below command.
```
docker swarm leave --force
```
Then try to 'docker-compose up' but getting this error. The solution was closing VPN in my case.
```
Creating network "docker-compose_default" with the default driver
ERROR: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network 
```

if you check the docker-compose file you can ask what drupal is. Shortly, [Drupal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal) is a free and open-source web content management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Also, our second image [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

Listing volumes
```
docker volume ls
```
Listing networks
```
docker network ls
```
Docker-compose is to create a new network on its own. When you use docker-compose down created network deleted automatically but volumes are not. You should use ```docker-compose down -v```
for the deleting created volumes with docker-compose.
